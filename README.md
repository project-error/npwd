NPWD is our flagship and current running project. Our team has been working on the project since August, 2020. This resource isn’t complete yet and currently has no ETA for release. Feel free to test it out in a dev environment by following the installation guide.

Written completely by the Project Error Dev Team in [React](https://reactjs.org/) with a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) client/server environment.

## Project Error Discord

- Join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYwBjTbAY5) to follow current development of the project.

## Documentation & Installation

- [Project-Error Docs](https://docs.projecterror.dev/#/) contains all the information regarding this resource. Please consult it for installation, dependencies, and other important information.

## Support

No support is being provided currently for the resource as it is still in an unfinished state.

Should you encounter any issues, please do the following:

- Check the [Git Kraken](https://app.gitkraken.com/glo/board/X9YZ_x_SVQEcMwpH) to see if the issue you're referring to is already tracked.
- Check the [State of Development](https://docs.projecterror.dev/#/npwd/state-of-dev?id=introduction) to see if the app is still a **WIP**.
  - If the issue isn't on the Git Kraken and the app is finished, please open an issue.
  - If the issue isn't on the Git Kraken and the app is **not** finished, please contact us in Discord.

We do not want issues opened that are due to the phone being **WIP** as this slows down development since we now have to address it more immediately.
